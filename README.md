# Network Traffic Analysis Tool using TCPDump and Wireshark

## Objective

Developed a tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic using TCPDump. The tool was built with features like saving captured packets, creating sequenced dump files, and decrypting SSL/TLS traffic with Wireshark. I used shell scripting to automate capturing traffic and storing it efficiently in dump files, enabling easier packet analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Network Traffic Analysis: Monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify suspicious patterns and security threats using tools like TCPDump and Wireshark, a critical skill for real-time threat detection in network security.
- Packet Capture and Analysis: Capture and analyze network packets to investigate and troubleshoot security incidents, vital for diagnosing network issues and identifying malicious activity.
- SSL/TLS Decryption: Decrypting SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark, enabling the inspection of encrypted data and enhancing the ability to detect hidden threats in secure communications.
- Shell Scripting: Built proficiency in automating routine security tasks and creating custom logging tools through Bash shell scripting.
- Network Security: Strengthened foundational knowledge in securing networks by understanding various attack vectors and defense mechanisms, applying these principles in a simulated environment to mitigate potential risks.

### Tools Used

- TCPDump
- Wireshark
- Bash (Shell)
